FusionC
=======================================================================

This is an XNA port of the Javascript space shooter Fusion. It uses XNA
4.0 and the Nuclex framework.

It exists to kill time and clear my head while I'm on a block on my SRPG
Armadillo, so whether or not this gets completed is a bit sketchy.

My main goals, aside from simply porting the game from Javascript to C#,
is to create a menu and help screen, add sounds effects, complete the HUD
to display weapons, and provide a longer game experience through semi
randomly generated levels.
